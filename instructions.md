Engineering Challenge - Web FrontEnd
Build the web frontend client of an “Address Book” application-

Implementation Details:
Your web client should initially display the list of persons from the address book. 
The user should be able to select a person from the list in order to see more details about that person.
Please use the API endpoints from https://randomuser.me/ (Documentation can be found at
https://randomuser.me/documentation ). 
Your client should be responsive.

Suggested UX hint:
    ● User should see the list of persons from the address book
    ● User should be able to select a person from the list and navigate to the details page
    ● User should be able to see the first name, last name, phone number on the details page


Deliverables
Please take your time to deliver a quality solution that shows your ability. 
Include:
    ● A README file that contains:
    ○ Deployment / running instructions. Assume that we’re running this on a Mac.



    ○ A summary of the assignment
    ■ Your overall approach
    ■ What features you implemented
    ■ Given more time, what else would you have liked to complete and how
      long it would have taken you?
    ■ Given more time, what else would you have done to make the project
      more robust?
    ● Production-ready code that:
    ○ Your code checked into a git repository that can be shared with us (Github,
      Gitlab, Bitbucket, etc…). We should be able to run the code
    ○ Follows community standard syntax and style
    ○ Has no debug logging, TODOs, or FIXMEs
    ○ Has test coverage to ensure quality and safety
  

   Bonus points if instructions are for deployments to a distributed cloud
  infrastructure
  What we look for
    ● Clean code. Style we’re looking for: concise but descriptive.
    ● Enough functionality or code to show us your understanding of fundamental
      development practices
    ● Test coverage for your code. Bonus point if you are able to perform Test Driven
      Development
    ● Bonus points: Code in a functional , concise, declarative way. Things we will look for:
      higher-order functions, function composition, correct use of basic data structures and
      manipulations (map, reduce, apply, etc.)
    ● Bonus points for managing asynchronous or concurrent execution through high-level
      abstractions
